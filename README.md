# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Introduction
This project was done for the Disaster Reporting Network, a non-profit company that provides data driven storytelling of disasters around the world. This project provides insightful data visualization with interactive features on eathquakes from around the world.

This repository consist's of two major parts:
- The Build Up
- The Challenge

## Summary
### The Build Up
This section comprises of a number of folders that show the step by step establishment fo the final map that will be used in the challenge part of this analysis.

This section consists of the following folders that corresponds to their contents by order of complexity from easy to difficult:
- Simple Map
- Mapping Multiple Points
- Mapping Lines
- Mapping GeoJSON Polygons
- Mapping GeoJSON Points
- Mapping GeoJSON Linestrings
- Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days

### The Challenge
The following project's challenge was to create maps and various overlays vis the use of JSON. There were three technical analysis deliverables for this project:
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

#### Deliverable 1
This deliverable required adding the tectonic plate to the already established map and also provides markers for each earthquakes that is the size and color of their magnitude and upon click, provides the information of both the magnitude and specific location. The map includes a color legend as well that indicated the severity/level of the earthquakes.

#### Deliverable 2
This deliverable involved identifying the major earthquakes of all that have occurred. This was done by establishing an additional overlay that helped those particular magnitudes to stand out around the world, apart from all the rest.

#### Deliverable 3
This deliverable established one last overlay of nighttime, or dark, to present an additional contrasting view of the map.

## Conclusion
This project is successfully completed. Please view the files in this GitHub repository for the full analysis.
